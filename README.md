# Healthcare

Machine Learning and Deep Learning applications for healthcare â€” predictive modeling, medical imaging, and data-driven insights.

# Overview

This repository explores the use of AI in healthcare, covering topics such as:

- Predictive modeling for patient outcomes

- Disease classification using ML/DL

- Medical imaging analysis with deep learning

- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis

- Research-inspired implementations

The goal is to combine machine learning techniques with real-world healthcare datasets to uncover insights, build models, and create reproducible experiments.

# Features

- ML & DL Models: From classical ML algorithms to modern neural networks
